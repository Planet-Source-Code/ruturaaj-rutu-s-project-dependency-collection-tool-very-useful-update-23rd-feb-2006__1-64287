Hello!

First of all I would like to say thanks for taking some time and downloading my code! Please test it as you want and let me know if there are any errors or feature-requests. I will surely try my best to implement those features and make this project look and work better than what presently it's capable of doing.

By no means, I developed this project to become a product for myself or for any other company! Actually I always felt a need of such tool while preparing the Project to distribute to either beta test programmers or to send the Project Files to my client. That time, I use to search for those all DLLs and OCX files on my system and then manually copy-paste those to my "Dependencies" folder under distribute directory. Moreover, all DLLs and OCX files are not stored at one central place on my system which use to make me to run through my system from one drive to other and collect all dependency files. I always wanted to have something this sort of tool which will automatically detect all the Dependency files referenced by Project, tell me if the Dependency file is missing/unregistered or everything is fine and then finally copy all (or selected) files to my specifyed Folder. 

Firstly, being an adicted PSC user, I searched for something similar on PSC; but as always I couldn't find anything in this sea of Visual Basic code! So, I decided that whenever I will get some free time, I will develop it on my own; finally I got some free time and so I developed it for my own purpose ... and believe me, it works like a magic for me! If you are like me, Freelance Programmer or a programmer who works for company on their Software projects as consultant, then you will love this tool! I'm using it for past few days and have solved few bugs to make it work stable. Now this tool is in your hands, please use it and let me know if there are any errors or it fails to detect/collect any of your project dependencies. I have not tested this Application on various VBP projects, but it should work well without any trouble.

If you like this tool then please vote for it and don't forget to leave comments please! Bug reports and Feature Requests are always welcome ... Feel free to contact me (mailme_friends@yahoo.com) anytime you feel like!

Once again thanks for downloading my code and using it! Looking forward to win your votes on PSC and waiting for your comments, as always ...

Regards,

Ruturaj.
